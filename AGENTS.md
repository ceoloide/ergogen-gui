# Ergogen Web UI

This project is a React-based web interface for the [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) project, including quality-of-life improvements to the users like live reload of outputs, integrated footprint libraries and loading directly from GitHub.

## Ergogen CLI

[Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) is a command line tool that allows users to define the characteristics of ergognomic keyboards (usually split ones) in YAML code, then generating assets to help fabricate the board. Ergogen helps with the general layout of the keys, the creation of a KiCad compatible PCB, the creation of DXF outlines for integration with other CAD software, and OpenJSCAD 3D models for keyboard case creation.

## Building and testing

- The project uses `yarn` to handle dependencies, build, test, and run the dev web server. While `npm` is present, it should not be used for any development related activities.
- Always use `yarn add` when you need to install a new dependency, do NOT use `npm` directly.
- Before making any changes, make sure the target builds and the tests pass. Use `yarn build` and `yarn test`, respectively.
- When running tests with `yarn test`, add the `--verbose` argument to see failure reasons and additional test details.
- Prefer test-drive development; first write the tests for the bug fix or new feature, make sure they fail in the expected way, then make them pass.
- Try to make tests fast, for example by mocking heavy operations or other similar things when appropriate.
- Use `yarn knip` to tidy up dependencies before finishing. Always ignore unusued files warning for files in the `patch` of `public` directories.
- Use `yarn format` and `yarn lint` to check and fix formatting errors before finishing. You MUST always run `yarn format` and `yarn lint` before committing any file.
- Run `yarn precommit` before any commit, which formats, lints, checks for dependencies, and runs tests. You MUST address all errors before proceeding. You can ignore warnings, just mentioning them to the user as a proposal for future refactoring.
- Global test setup for Jest should be placed in `src/setupTests.js`. This file is automatically loaded by the test runner and does not require manual configuration.

## Design principles

- When writing unit tests, follow the "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern and clearly delineate the three.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Follow a strict "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle. Before implementing any new feature or bug fix, first write a failing test that clearly defines the expected outcome. Then, write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass. Finally, refactor the code while ensuring the tests continue to pass.
- Components should be accessible. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`) where appropriate to ensure a good user experience for everyone, including users of assistive technologies. This also improves testability.
- Tests should be robust and user-centric. Prefer selecting elements by user-facing attributes (like accessible name, text, or role) over implementation details (like class names or DOM structure). Use `data-testid` for elements where no other stable, user-facing selector is available.
- **Centralized Theming**: All colors and other theme-related properties (e.g., font sizes, spacing) should be centralized in `src/theme/theme.ts`. Components should import and use variables from this theme file instead of using hardcoded values.
- **Styled Components for Styling**: All styling, including global styles, should be managed using `styled-components`. Global styles should be defined in a `GlobalStyle` component to ensure consistency and encapsulation within the React component architecture, avoiding the use of separate CSS files like `index.css`.

## Development environment

### Linting and formatting

- The project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting.
- All ESLint configuration is managed in the `eslint.config.js` file at the root of the project. This is the single source of truth for linting rules.
- The `eslintConfig` key in `package.json` is deprecated for this project and must not be used.
- The configuration in `eslint.config.js` includes specific settings for test files (e.g., `*.test.tsx`, `setupTests.js`) to provide the necessary Jest globals and rules.

## Coding principles

- Code should always prioritize human legibility and clarity over least lines of codes.
- Prioritize small and incremental changes, captured in a single commit. It's easier for a human reviewer to spend 5 minutes to review a small change than set aside 30 minutes to review a large one. In general each change should be a self-contained one, this means that:
  - The change addresses **just one thing**. This is usally just one part of a feature, rather than the whole feature at once.
  - The change should include related test code.
  - The commit description should explain what the committed changes aim to address. Avoid repeating the same general context, and focus on information that makes it possible for the reviewer to understand the change and the reasoning behind it. Briefly call out things that will be implemented at a later stage, but avoid including too much future planning.

## Knowledge base

Your task is to record important information in this file (`AGENTS.md`), which acts as a knowledge base. Analyze your chat history and `AGENTS.md` sections to propose changes, adidtions, or deletions. These changes will inform future actions in the same repository for the same user.

### User preferences & instructions

- **Always run tests in headless/CI mode.** When running tests, ensure they are configured to execute once and exit, without entering interactive watch mode.
- **Propose a plan before complex refactoring.** For non-trivial changes, especially concerning tests or core logic, present a plan of action before implementing it. This allows for feedback and ensures alignment.
- **Critique your work and log follow-up tasks.** After making significant changes, provide a critique of the work, identifying areas for improvement. Log these areas as actionable items in the AGENTS.md "Future Tasks" section. This formalizes the process we followed after the test refactoring.
- **CRITICAL: Confirm task completion before removal.** You **MUST** always confirm with the user that a task from the "Future Tasks" list is complete before removing it from this document. Once the user confirms, and only then, the task should be removed from the "Future Tasks" section.
- **Focus on a single failing test.** When fixing tests, run only the specific test that you are currently working on. This isolates the problem and speeds up the feedback cycle.
- **Focus on relevant lint errors.** When running the linter, only address errors that are directly related to the files and code you have modified. It is acceptable to ignore pre-existing, unrelated errors in other parts of the codebase.
- **Use the Theme File**: When implementing or modifying UI components, you **MUST** use variables from the theme file (`src/theme/theme.ts`) for all colors and other theme-related properties. If a required value is not present in the theme, you **MUST** add it.

### Instructions on proposals to change the knowlege base

When creating proposals for the knowledge base, primarily focus on extracting information from these categories:

- **User Preferences & Instructions**
  - **Directives**: Record direct, persistent commands from the user that shold act as rules for future tasks (e.g., "Always add type hints", "Do not run tests unless asked").
  - **Style & Conventions**: Document explicity preferences for programming languages, frameworks, libraries, coding styles, and formatting rules. Not they shouldn't be task specific but things that can apply for entire codebase.
- **Repository & Project Context**
  - **Purpose & Architecture**: Summarize the repository's primary purpose and architectural patterns (e.g., "microservices architecture").
- **Environment & Execution**
  - **Setup Commands**: Detail the exact, sequential commands required to set up the development environment and install all dependencies if they are proven useful.
  - **Execution Commands**: List the commands needed to build, test, and run the project (e.g., `yarn build`, `yarn test`) if they are proven useful.

### Guiding Principles

- **Concise & Factual**: Each proposal must be a concise, verifiable fact. Avoid assumptions. Ask the user if you need additional details.
- **Quality over quantity**: Be extremely cautious when creating proposals. Prioritize creating fewer, high-quality proposal for the knowledge base over a wide range of mediocre ones. When in doubt about whether a piece of information should be stored, do not store it.
- **Filter for long-term relevance**: Record information that has long-term relevance. DO NOT record temporary, task-specific details or the exact feature request.
  - **Example**:
    - **DO record**: "The project uses Yarn for dependency management"
    - **DO NOT record**: "The user wants to refactor button style rules"
    - **DO NOT record**: "I have completed the task to create a new welcome page for the web app."

## Future Tasks

When adding a new future task, always structure them with a unique ID, a brief title, the context, and the task, for example:

```md
### TASK-001: Eliminate Magic Values in Tests

**Context:** During a refactoring of the `InjectionRow.tsx` component, the test suite was improved to check for the presence of a green highlight when a row is active. The test currently asserts that the border color is a hardcoded hex value (`#28a745`).

**Task:** Refactor the test to remove this "magic value." This can be achieved by defining theme colors in a central location (e.g., a `theme.ts` file), exporting them, and importing the color variable into both the `InjectionRow.tsx` component and its test file, `InjectionRow.test.tsx`.
I also want you to add instructions on how to structure and add future tasks.
```

### [TASK-001] Redundant State in ConfigContextProvider

Description: The ConfigContextProvider component uses multiple individual useState hooks for settings like debug, autoGen, autoGen3D, kicanvasPreview, and jscadPreview. It then manually saves each of these to localStorage in a useEffect hook. This approach is verbose and leads to a lot of boilerplate code.

Proposed Fix: I will refactor this by consolidating all these settings into a single settings object, managed by a single useState hook. I can then use the useLocalStorage hook to automatically persist this entire settings object to local storage. This will significantly reduce the amount of code, eliminate the manual useEffect, and make the component cleaner and less error-prone.

### [TASK-002] Unnecessary Prop Drilling

Description: Currently, the main App.tsx component initializes the configInput state and then passes both the state and its setter function (setConfigInput) as props to the ConfigContextProvider. However, ConfigContextProvider is the component that actually uses and manages this state. This is a classic case of unnecessary prop drilling.

Proposed Fix: I will move the useState hook for configInput directly into the ConfigContextProvider. This will make the context provider the single source of truth for the configuration, which is more aligned with its purpose. It will also simplify App.tsx and make the overall data flow of the application more logical and easier to follow.

### [TASK-003] Complex runGeneration Function

Description: The runGeneration function is a critical part of the application, but it has grown to be very long and complex. It currently handles multiple distinct responsibilities: parsing the configuration, checking for deprecation warnings, preparing a simplified config for previews, and finally executing the generation process. This makes the function difficult to read, test, and debug.

Proposed Fix: I will break down the runGeneration function into several smaller, more focused functions. For example, I can create separate utility functions for parseConfig, checkForDeprecationWarnings, preparePreviewConfig, and executeGeneration. This will make the main runGeneration function a much simpler coordinator of these smaller functions, improving readability, maintainability, and making it much easier to write targeted unit tests.
